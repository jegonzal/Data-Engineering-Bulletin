\section{Conclusion}While our community will surely grapple with unanticipated complexities over the next weeks, months, and years, we have a call-to-action in this moment and a hope for building a more resilient future. The future needs us to learn from the past and presentâ€”to deploy an inherently human-centered approach that connects research with the realities of crisis management, long-term recovery, and the vulnerabilities of being human. The future needs us to ask \emph{Can we?} and \emph{Should we?} as we learn how to harness the full potential of our collective resources.
