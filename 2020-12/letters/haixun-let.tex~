One of the beauties of the Data Engineering Bulletin, with a history

of 43 years and 157 issues, is that it chronicles how topics of
database research evolve and sometimes reinvent themselves over
time. Phil Bernstein's opinion piece in this issue, titled
``Resurrecting Middle-Tier Distributed Transactions,'' is another
testimony to this beauty. Bernstein tells an interesting story of
transaction processing monitors running on middle-tier servers, and
predicts the return of middle-tier distributed transactions to the
mainstream after a 15-year decline.

Guoliang Li put together the current issue consisting of 6 papers on
the interactions between database systems and AI. This is a
fascinating topic. Traditional databases are heavily optimized
monolithic systems designed with heuristics and assumptions. But
recent work has shown that critical data structures such as database
indices are merely models, and can be replaced with more flexible,
faster, and smaller machine learned models such as neural
networks. This opens the door to using data driven approaches for
system design. On the other hand, deep learning is still facing the
challenge in incorporating database accesses in end-to-end training,
which hampers the use of existing structured knowledge in learning.
