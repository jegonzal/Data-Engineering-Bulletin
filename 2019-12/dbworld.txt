The December 2019 issue of the Data Engineering Bulletin is now
available electronically via the IEEE Computer Society Bulletin web
site http://tab.computer.org/tcde/bull_about.html. The ISSUES pages
are maintained both at the IEEE Computer Society
(http://sites.computer.org/debull/bull_issues.html) and at Microsoft
(ftp://ftp.research.microsoft.com/pub/debull/bull_issues.html).

In this issue, Michael Stonebreaker and El Kindi Rezig of MIT authored
an opinion piece “Machine Learning and Big Data: What is Important?”
Drawing from their experience working with big data in real-life
medical and business applications, they highlighted the role of data
management for machine learning.

Lei Chen of HKUST put together an interesting issue consisting of 5
papers on the topic of “Future of Work.” They envisioned a future
where AI and machines automate most of the work, but humans are in the
loop to provide intellectual self-actualization.
