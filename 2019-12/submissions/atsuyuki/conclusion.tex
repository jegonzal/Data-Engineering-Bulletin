\label{sec:conclusion}

Online job platforms are becoming increasingly popular.
They provide an alternative job arrangement that has the potential to dramatically affect the Future of Work. 
An increasing proportion of human workforce will be employed in such platforms.
Hence, it is very important to study the problem of platform design.
In this paper, we have a preliminary attempt at investigating this problem.
We provide a taxonomy of platforms and what are the major missing functionalities for both workers and requesters. 
We also advocate the need for interoperability between platforms.
This allows workers and requesters to move their data between platforms without getting locked into a single platform. 
There are a number of interesting research and policy challenges in achieving the vision of platform interoperability.
