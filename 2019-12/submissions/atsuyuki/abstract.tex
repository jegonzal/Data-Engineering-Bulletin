\begin{abstract}
Online job platforms have proliferated in the last few years.
We anticipate a future where there exists thousands of such platforms covering wide swathes of tasks.
These include crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), CrowdWorks, Figure Eight;
specialized services such as ride-hailing;
matching markets such as TaskRabbit that matches workers with local demand and so on.
It is widely anticipated that a vast majority of human workforce will be employed in these platforms.
In this article, we initiate discussions about the under studied aspect of \emph{platform design} --
how to design platforms that maximize the satisfaction of various stakeholders.
We also contribute a novel taxonomy for platform ecosystems
that categorizes existing and emerging platforms.
Finally, we discuss the need for interoperability between these platforms
so that workers and requesters are not tied to a single platform.
