abstract ={In this paper we develop a knowledge-based theory of the firm. While existing knowledge-based theory focuses on the efficiency of hierarchy in economizing on knowledge exchange, we develop a theory of the firm that focuses on the efficiency of alternative organizational forms in generating knowledge or capability. Our theory begins with the problem as the basic unit of analysis, arguing that a problem's complexity influences the optimal method of solution search and the optimal means of organizing that search. The distinguishing feature that differentiates among organizational alternatives is the different way each resolves conflict over the selection of solution trials, that is, the way it chooses the path of search. Our theory predicts that efficiency demands that these governance alternatives be matched in a discriminating way to problems based on their associated benefits and costs in governing solution search. Thus, our theory is among the first to simultaneously treat both the boundary choice (i.e., internal versus external) and the choice among alternative internal approaches to organizing.},

abstract ={The creation of the public corporation in the 19th century drove out the partnership                 as the predominant form of organizational governance. Yet, within the professional                 services sector, partnerships have survived and prospered. Moreover, professional                 services firms that chose to abandon the partnership form tended to become private                 rather than public corporations. Drawing upon several theories, we compare the                 efficiency of the partnership relative to corporate forms of governance in the                 context of the professional services sector. We argue that the professional                 partnership minimizes agency costs associated with both the private and public                 corporation. We also argue from tournament theory and property rights theory that                 partnerships have superior incentive systems for professionals in particular and                 knowledge workers more generally. However, drawing upon structural-contingency                 theory, we identify limiting conditions, which affect the relative efficiency of the                 partnership. We argue that the corporation, especially the private corporation, will                 be the preferred form of governance where the limiting conditions are prevalent.                 Nevertheless, we also argue that under specific conditions the partnership form of                 governance will persist and prosper because it remains unusually suited to the                 management of knowledge workers.},

In a multimethod study of one open source software community, we found that members developed a shared basis of formal authority but limited it with democratic mechanisms that enabled experimentation with shifting conceptions of authority over time. When members settled on a shared conception of authority, it was more expansive than their original design. A statistical test of the predictors of leadership reinforced this finding. By blending bureaucratic and democratic mechanisms, the governance system evolved with the community's changing conceptions of authority.},

               The problem and the solution. As more attention has turned to knowledge management in organizations, there has been an increasing shift in focus from technology solutions to social dimensions. It is the focus on people and the management of knowledge-sharing processes that has lacked attention in the literature and is of particular importance to the HRD profession. Knowledge sharing has been identified as the most critical factor in knowledge management, yet we do not fully understand how individuals share knowledge or the role social structures such as teams and work-related communities could play in an overall knowledge management strategy. Through a review of the literature, the authors explore types of social structures in organizations and the knowledge shared within these structures. From this review, they suggest potential new ways of thinking about the role of HRD in the design of social structures and the facilitation of knowledge-sharing processes.},

abstract ={We use a simple, sociophysical, agent-based model to gain insight into the relationship between the strength of academic research groups and the researchers they contain and to investigate the optimal size of research groups in a number of academic disciplines. The model suggests a linear relationship between group research quality and group quantity up to an upper critical mass. It further suggests that above this size, research quality no longer increases significantly with group quantity due to a tendency for large research groups to fragment. We use the results of the UK's Research Assessment Exercise to establish empirical evidence that, although the best research groups tend to be large, they frequently tend to have characteristics more akin to small and medium groups. This may be interpreted as indicating that the optimal size of research groups is slightly in excess of the upper critical mass. We speculate that a strong degree of cohesiveness lies behind the success of such groups. The principle managerial message coming from this analysis is that emulation of such success involves optimization of the quality and quantity of communication links between research group members.},
