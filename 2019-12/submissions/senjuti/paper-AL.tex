The goal of this article is to propose an {\em optimization framework by acknowledging human factors to  enable label acquisition through active learning }. In particular, we are interested to investigate tasks, such as, providing (collecting or acquiring) and validating labels, or comparing data using active learning techniques. Our basic approach is to take a set of existing {\em active learning techniques for a few well known supervised and unsupervised algorithms, but study them in the context of crowdsourcing, especially considering worker-centric optimization (i,e., human factors)}. Our innovation lies in  designing optimization functions that appropriately capture these two fundamental yet complementary facets, performing systematic investigation to understand the complexity of such optimization problems, and designing efficient solutions with theoretical guarantees.

\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.1in}
The goal of this article is to propose an {\em an optimized human-machine intelligence
framework for single and multi-label tasks through active learning}.  We conceptualize an iterative framework that judiciously employs human workers to collect single or multiple labels associated with such tasks, which, in turn are used by the supervised machine algorithms to make intelligent prediction. Our basic approach is adapt a few existing {\em active learning techniques for single and multi-label classification, but study them in the context of crowdsourcing, especially considering worker-centric optimization, i,e., human factors}. Our innovation lies in systematically characterizing variables to model human factors, designing optimization models that appropriately combine system and worker-centric goals, and designing effective solutions.
