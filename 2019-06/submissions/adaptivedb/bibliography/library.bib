@article{Fan2000,
abstract = {The sharing of caches among Web proxies is an important technique to reduce Web traffic and alleviate network bottlenecks. Nevertheless it is not widely deployed due to the overhead of existing protocols. In this paper we demonstrate the benefits of cache sharing, measure the overhead of the existing protocols, and propose a new protocol called {\&}ldquo;summary cache{\&}rdquo;. In this new protocol, each proxy keeps a summary of the cache directory of each participating proxy, and checks these summaries for potential hits before sending any queries. Two factors contribute to our protocol's low overhead: the summaries are updated only periodically, and the directory representations are very economical, as low as 8 bits per entry. Using trace-driven simulations and a prototype implementation, we show that, compared to existing protocols such as the Internet cache protocol (ICP), summary cache reduces the number of intercache protocol messages by a factor of 25 to 60, reduces the bandwidth consumption by over 50{\%}, eliminates 30{\%} to 95{\%} of the protocol CPU overhead, all while maintaining almost the same cache hit ratios as ICP. Hence summary cache scales to a large number of proxies. (This paper is a revision of Fan et al. 1998; we add more data and analysis in this version.)},

abstract = {Hash join algorithms suffer from extensive CPU cache stalls. We show that the standard hash join algorithm/or disk-oriented databases (i.e. GRACE) spends over 73{\%} of its user time stalled on CPU cache misses, and explores the use of prefetching to improve its cache performance. Applying prefetching to hash joins is complicated by the data dependencies, multiple code paths, and inherent randomness of hashing. We present two techniques, group prefetching and software-pipelined prefetching, that overcome these complications. These schemes achieve 2.0-2.9X speedups for the join phase and 1.4-2.6X speedups for the partition phase over GRACE and simple prefetching approaches. Compared with previous cache-aware approaches (i.e. cache partitioning), the schemes are at least 50{\%} faster on large relations and do not require exclusive use of the CPU cache to be effective.},

@article{Neumann2009,
abstract = {RDF is a data model for schema-free structured information that is gaining momentum in the context of Semantic-Web data, life sciences, and also Web 2.0 platforms. The "pay-as-you-go" nature of RDF and the flexible pattern-matching capabilities of its query language SPARQL entail efficiency and scalability challenges for complex queries including long join paths. This paper presents the RDF-3X engine, an implementation of SPARQL that achieves excellent performance by pursuing a RISC-style architecture with streamlined indexing and query processing. The physical design is identical for all RDF-3X databases regardless of their workloads, and completely eliminates the need for index tuning by exhaustive indexes for all permutations of subject-property-object triples and their binary and unary projections. These indexes are highly compressed, and the query processor can aggressively leverage fast merge joins with excellent performance of processor caches. The query optimizer is able to choose optimal join orders even for complex queries, with a cost model that includes statistical synopses for entire join paths. Although RDF-3X is optimized for queries, it also provides good support for efficient online updates by means of a staging architecture: direct updates to the main database indexes are deferred, and instead applied to compact differential indexes which are later merged into the main indexes in a batched manner. Experimental studies with several large-scale datasets with more than 50 million RDF triples and benchmark queries that include pattern matching, manyway star-joins, and long path-joins demonstrate that RDF-3X can outperform the previously best alternatives by one or two orders of magnitude.},

abstract = {As scientific instruments and computer simulations produce more and more data, the task of locating the essential information to gain insight becomes increasingly difficult. FastBit is an efficient software tool to address this challenge. In this article, we present a summary of the key underlying technologies, namely bitmap compression, encoding, and binning. Together these techniques enable FastBit to answer structured (SQL) queries orders of magnitude faster than popular database systems. To illustrate how FastBit is used in applications, we present three examples involving a high-energy physics experiment, a combustion simulation, and an accelerator simulation. In each case, FastBit significantly reduces the response time and enables interactive exploration on terabytes of data.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, new solid state storage technologies, with flash being the most mature one, have become increasingly popular. Such technologies store data durably, and can alleviate many hand- icaps of hard disk drives (HDDs). Nonetheless, they have very different characteristics compared to HDDs, making it challenging to integrate such technologies into data intensive systems, such as database management systems (DBMS), that rely heavily on underlying storage behaviors. In this paper, we ask the question: Where and how will flash be exploited in a DBMS? We describe techniques for making effective use of flash in three contexts: (i) as a log device for transaction processing on memory-resident data, (ii) as the main data store for transaction processing, and (iii) as an update cache for HDD-resident data warehouses.},

abstract = {Bloom filters are probabilistic data structures that have been successfully used for approximate membership problems in many areas of Computer Science (networking, distributed systems, databases, etc.). With the huge increase in data size and distribution of data, problems arise where a large number of Bloom filters are available, and all the Bloom filters need to be searched for potential matches. As an example, in a federated cloud environment, with hundreds of geographically distributed clouds participating in the federation, information needs to be shared by the semi-autonomous cloud providers. Each cloud provider could encode the information using Bloom filters and share the Bloom filters with a central coordinator. The problem of interest is not only whether a given object is in any of the sets represented by the Bloom filters, but which of the existing sets contain the given object. This problem cannot be solved by just constructing a Bloom filter on the union of all the sets. We propose Bloofi, a hierarchical index structure for Bloom filters that speeds-up the search process and can be efficiently constructed and maintained. We apply our index structure to the problem of determining the complete data provenance graph in a geographically distributed setting. Our theoretical and experimental results show that Bloofi provides a scalable and efficient solution for searching through a large number of Bloom filters.},

@article{Gray2004,
abstract = {Database system architectures are undergoing revolutionary changes. Algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this, each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow applica-tions. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core. Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms. Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in; new algorithms can be added. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods, along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems. Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective.These changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy. Intelligence is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program these systems. Database systems are now expected to be self-managing, self-healing, and always-up.},

@phdthesis{Boncz2002,
abstract = {Monet is a database kernel targeted at query-intensive, heavy analysis applications (the opposite of transaction processing), which include OLAP and data mining, but also go beyond the business domain in GIS processing, multi-media retrieval and XML. The clean sheet approach of Monet tries to depart from the traditional RDBMS design and implementation patterns in an attempt to obtain best performance on modern hardware, which has changed a lot since the currently dominant relational database systems were designed and developed. While most hardware components have experienced exponential growth in power over the years (a.k.a. Moore's law), I/O and especially memory latency have been lagging, creating an exponentially growing bottleneck. Additionally, modern hyperpipelined CPUs increasingly require code that is fully predictable (as to avoid branch mispredictions) and independent (to exploit parallel execution units) in order to reach their advertised performance, which makes a tough match with the interpreted, highly unpredictable and interdependent code found in database execution engines. The choice in Monet for the Decomposed Storage Model (DSM), which stores data in binary (2-column) tables only is motivated by the fact that query-intensive access patterns often profit from a vertically fragmented physical data model, which minimizes both I/O and cache misses when queries touch many rows but few columns. The column-wise processing model followed in the MIL language allows for a ``RISC'' (Reduced Instruction Set) query processing algebra, whose operators have a very low degree of freedom, thus allowing for a CPU-wise highly efficient implementation (i.e. one that consists of predictable and independent instructions). Also, specific attention was paid in Monet in developing cache-conscious query processing algorithms, in particular the radix-algorithms for join processing. This thesis is a reference to the Monet system in all its detail, and also outlines an SQL front-end that uses Monet as a back-end, for constructing a full-fledged SQL compliant RDBMS including ACID properties.},

@article{Strukov2008,
abstract = {Anyone who ever took an electronics laboratory class will be familiar with the fundamental passive circuit elements: the resistor, the capacitor and the inductor. However, in 1971 Leon Chua reasoned from symmetry arguments that there should be a fourth fundamental element, which he called a memristor (short for memory resistor). Although he showed that such an element has many interesting and valuable circuit properties, until now no one has presented either a useful physical model or an example of a memristor. Here we show, using a simple analytical example, that memristance arises naturally in nanoscale systems in which solid-state electronic and ionic transport are coupled under an external bias voltage. These results serve as the foundation for understanding a wide range of hysteretic current-voltage behaviour observed in many nanoscale electronic devices that involve the motion of charged atomic or molecular species, in particular certain titanium dioxide cross-point switches.},

The design of the query processor meets three major objectives: the query processor must be manufacturable using existing and near-term LSI (VLSI) technology; it must support in a uniform manner both the numeric and nonnumeric processing requirements a high-level user interface like SQL presents; and it must support the query-processing strategy derived in the query optimizer to satisfy certain system-wide performance optimality criteria.},

@inproceedings{Megiddo2003,
abstract = {We consider the problem of cache management in a demand paging scenario with uniform page sizes. We propose a new cache management policy, namely, Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC), that has several advantages. In response to evolving and changing access patterns, ARC dynamically, adaptively, and continually balances between the recency and frequency components in an online and selftuning fashion. The policy ARC uses a learning rule to adaptively and continually revise its assumptions about the workload. The policy ARC is empirically universal, that is, it empirically performs as well as a certain fixed replacement policy-even when the latter uses the best workload-specific tuning parameter that was selected in an offline fashion. Consequently, ARC works uniformly well across varied workloads and cache sizes without any need for workload specific a priori knowledge or tuning. Various policies such as LRU-2, 2Q, LRFU, and LIRS require user-defined parameters, and, unfortunately, no single choice works uniformly well across different workloads and cache sizes. The policy ARC is simple-to-implement and, like LRU, has constant complexity per request. In comparison, policies LRU-2 and LRFU both require logarithmic time complexity in the cache size. The policy ARC is scan-resistant: it allows one-time sequential requests to pass through without polluting the cache.},

@inproceedings{Stoica2009,
abstract = {In the last few years NAND flash storage has become more and more popular as price per GB and capacity both improve at exponential rates. Flash memory offers significant benefits compared to magnetic hard disk drives (HDDs) and DBMSs are highly likely to use flash as a general storage backend, either alone or in heterogeneous storage solutions with HDDs. Flash devices, however, respond quite differently than HDDs for common access patterns, and recent research shows a strong asymmetry between read and write performance. Moreover, flash storage devices behave unpredictably, showing a high dependence on previous IO history and usage patterns. In this paper we investigate how a DBMS can overcome these issues to take full advantage of flash memory as persistent storage. We propose new a flash aware data layout append and pack which stabilizes device performance by eliminating random writes. We assess the impact of append and pack on OLTP workload performance using both an analytical model and micro-benchmarks, and our results suggest that significant improvements can be achieved for real workloads.},

abstract = {This paper extends earlier research on hash-join algorithms to a multiprocessor architecture. Implementations of a number of centralized join algorithms are described and measured. Evaluation of these algorithms served to verify earlier analylical results. In addition, they demonstrate that bit vector filtering provides dramatic improvement in the performance of all algorithms including the sort mergejoin algorithm. Multiprocessor configurations of the centralized Grace and Hybrid hash-join algorithms are also presented. Both algorithms arc shown to provide linear increases in throughput with corresponding increases in processor and disk resources.},

abstract = {While search engines are the most popular way to find information on the web, they are generally not used to query relational databases (RDBs). This paper describes a technique for making the data in an RDB accessible to standard search engines. The technique involves using a URL to express queries and creating a wrapper that can then process the URL-query and generate web pages that contain the answer to the query as well as links to additional data. By following these links, a crawler is able to index the RDB along with all the URL-queries. Once the content and their corresponding URL-queries have been indexed, a user may submit keyword queries through a standard search engine and receive up-to-date database information. The system was then tested to determine if it could return results that were similar to those submitted using SQL. We also looked at whether a standard search engine such as Google could actually index the database content appropriately.},

@phdthesis{Estivill-Castro1991a,
abstract = {It has been observed that, in practice, sequences to be sorted are often nearly sorted. Nearly sorted or presorted sequences are regarded as easier instances of the sorting problem and sorting algorithms that perform a number of comparisons that is a nondecreasing function of the size and the difficulty of a problem instance are called adaptive. This thesis is concerned with adaptive sorting algorithms. Existing order in a sequence is evaluated using what we call a measure of disorder. If a measure of disorder satisfies some additional properties we obtain what has been called a measure of presortedness. We explore the axiomatic definition of measures of presortedness and how it reflects intuition, and we design schemes to compare different measures of disorder. The relationship between right invariant metrics, used in Statistics to evaluate; correlation in ranking models, and measures of presortedness is studied. One result of this investigation is that we are able to obtain a general method to generate pseudo-random nearly sorted sequences. A new measure of presortedness related to sorting in mesh-connected processor arrays is defined and we present optimal sorting algorithms for this measure. We also give a generic adaptive sorting algorithm that is the basis of anew adaptive sorting algorithm that is not only practical, but also optimal with respect to five important measures of presortedness. We characterize, for the first time, the adaptive behavior of two variants of Quicksort. Motivated by these results, and since previous work used only worst-case analysis, we explore expected-case optimality with respect to measures of presortedness. We establish the corresponding theory and present three new sorting algorithms and their analyses: Randomized Quicksort is shown to be adaptive with respect to Exchange, in the expected case; Randomized Mergesort is shown to be Runs-optimal in the expected case; and Skip Sort is shown to be optimal with respect to five important measures in the expected case.},

Specifically, only two hash functions are necessary to effectively implement a Bloom filter without any loss in the asymptotic false positive probability.

abstract = {To design a relational database integrating clinical and basic science data needed for multidisciplinary treatment and research in the field of vascular anomalies. Based on data points agreed on by the American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology (ASPO) Vascular Anomalies Task Force. The database design enables sharing of data subsets in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant manner for multisite collaborative trials. Vascular anomalies pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Our understanding of these lesions and treatment improvement is limited by nonstandard terminology, severity assessment, and measures of treatment efficacy. The rarity of these lesions places a premium on coordinated studies among multiple participant sites.},

abstract = {Bloom filters provide space-efficient storage of sets at the cost of a probability of false positives on membership queries. The size of the filter must be defined a priori based on the number of elements to store and the desired false positive probability, being impossible to store extra elements without increasing the false positive probability. This leads typically to a conservative assumption regarding maximum set size, possibly by orders of magnitude, and a consequent space waste. This paper proposes Scalable Bloom Filters, a variant of Bloom filters that can adapt dynamically to the number of elements stored, while assuring a maximum false positive probability.},

@inproceedings{Lu2011,
abstract = {A Bloom Filter (BF) is a data structure based on probability to compactly represent/record a set of elements (keys). It has wide applications on efficiently identifying a key that has been seen before with minimum amount of recording space used. BF is heavily used in chunking based data de-duplication. Traditionally, a BF is implemented as in-RAM data structure; hence its size is limited by the available RAM space on the machine. For certain applications like data de-duplication that require a big BF beyond the size of available RAM space, it becomes necessary to store a BF into a secondary storage device. Since BF operations are inherently random in nature, magnetic disk provides worse performance for the random read and write operations. It will not be a good fit for storing the large BF. Flash memory based Solid State Drive (SSD) has been considered as an emerging storage device that has superior performance and can potentially replace disks as the preferred secondary storage devices. However, several special characteristics of flash memory make designing a flash memory based BF very challenging. In this paper, our goal is to design an efficient flash memory based BF that is fully aware of these physical characteristics. To this end, we propose a Forest-structured BF design (FBF). FBF uses a combination of RAM and flash memory to design a BF. BF is stored on the flash, while RAM helps to mitigate the impact of slow write performance of flash memory. In addition, in-flash BF is organized in a forest-like structure in order to improve the lookup performance. Our experimental results show that FBF design achieves 2 times faster processing speed with 50{\%} less number of flash write operations when compared with the existing flash memory based BF designs.},

@inproceedings{Harizopoulos2005,
abstract = {Relational DBMS typically execute concurrent queries independently by invoking a set of operator instances for each query. To exploit common data retrievals and computation in concurrent queries, researchers have proposed a wealth of techniques, ranging from buffering disk pages to constructing materialized views and optimizing multiple queries. The ideas proposed, however, are inherently limited by the query-centric philosophy of modern engine designs. Ideally, the query engine should proactively coordinate same-operator execution among concurrent queries, thereby exploiting common accesses to memory and disks as well as common intermediate result computation.This paper introduces on-demand simultaneous pipelining (OSP), a novel query evaluation paradigm for maximizing data and work sharing across concurrent queries at execution time. OSP enables proactive, dynamic operator sharing by pipelining the operator's output simultaneously to multiple parent nodes. This paper also introduces QPipe, a new operator-centric relational engine that effortlessly supports OSP. Each relational operator is encapsulated in a micro-engine serving query tasks from a queue, naturally exploiting all data and work sharing opportunities. Evaluation of QPipe built on top of BerkeleyDB shows that QPipe achieves a 2x speedup over a commercial DBMS when running a workload consisting of TPC-H queries.},

abstract = {Accurate prediction of operator execution time is a prerequisite for database query optimization. Although extensively studied for conventional disk-based DBMSs, cost modeling in main-memory DBMSs is still an open issue. Recent database research has demonstrated that memory access is more and more becoming a significant-- if not the major--cost component of database operations. If used properly, fast but small cache memories--usually organized in cascading hierarchy between CPU and main memory--can help to reduce memory access costs. However, they make the cost estimation problem more complex. In this article, we propose a generic technique to create accurate cost functions for database operations. We identify a few basic memory access patterns and provide cost functions that estimate their access costs for each level of the memory hierarchy. The cost functions are parameterized to accommodate various hardware characteristics appropriately. Combining the basic patterns, we can describe the memory access patterns of database operations. The cost functions of database operations can automatically be derived by combining the basic patterns' cost functions accordingly. To validate our approach, we performed experiments using our DBMS prototype Monet. The results presented here confirm the accuracy of our cost models for different operations. Aside from being useful for query optimization, our models provide insight to tune algorithms not only in a main-memory DBMS, but also in a disk-based DBMS with a large main-memory buffer cache.},

abstract = {Probabilistic techniques for verification of finite-state transition systems offer huge memory savings over deterministic techniques. The two leading probabilistic schemes are hash compaction and the bitstate method, which stores states in a Bloom filter. Bloom filters have been criticized for being slow, inaccurate, and memory-inefficient, but in this paper, we show how to obtain Bloom filters that are simultaneously fast, accurate, memory-efficient, scalable, and flexible. The idea is that we can introduce large dependences among the hash functions of a Bloom filter with almost no observable effect on accuracy, and because computation of independent hash functions was the dominant computational cost of accurate Bloom filters and model checkers based on them, our savings are tremendous. We present a mathematical analysis of Bloom filters in verification in unprecedented detail, which enables us to give a fresh comparison between hash compaction and Bloom filters. Finally, we validate our work and analyses with extensive testing using 3SPIN, a model checker we developed by extending SPIN.},

abstract = {To provide the scientific community with a single, centralized, authoritative resource for protein sequences and functional information, the Swiss-Prot, TrEMBL and PIR protein database activities have united to form the Universal Protein Knowledgebase (UniProt) consortium. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive, fully classified, richly and accurately annotated protein sequence knowledgebase, with extensive cross-references and query interfaces. The central database will have two sections, corresponding to the familiar Swiss-Prot (fully manually curated entries) and TrEMBL (enriched with automated classification, annotation and extensive cross-references). For convenient sequence searches, UniProt also provides several non-redundant sequence databases. The UniProt NREF (UniRef) databases provide representative subsets of the knowledgebase suitable for efficient searching. The comprehensive UniProt Archive (UniParc) is updated daily from many public source databases. The UniProt databases can be accessed online (http://www.uniprot.org) or downloaded in several formats (ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub). The scientific community is encouraged to submit data for inclusion in UniProt.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the transaction management aspects of the R distributed database system. It concentrates primarily on the description of the R commit protocols, Presumed Abort (PA) and Presumed Commit (PC). PA and PC are extensions of the well-known, two-phase (2P) commit protocol. PA is optimized for read-only transactions and a class of multisite update transactions, and PC is optimized for other classes of multisite update transactions. The optimizations result in reduced intersite message traffic and log writes, and, consequently, a better response time. The paper also discusses R's approach toward distributed deadlock detection and resolution.},

@article{Johnson2011,
abstract = {The shift to multi-core and multi-socket hardware brings new challenges to database systems, as the software parallelism determines performance. Even though database systems traditionally accommodate simultaneous requests, a multitude of synchronization barriers serialize execution. Write-ahead logging is a fundamental, omnipresent component in ARIES-style concurrency and recovery, and one of the most important yet-to-be addressed potential bottlenecks, especially in OLTP workloads making frequent small changes to data. In this paper, we identify four logging-related impediments to database system scalability. Each issue challenges different level in the software architecture: (a) the high volume of small-sized I/O requests may saturate the disk, (b) transactions hold locks while waiting for the log flush, (c) extensive context switching overwhelms the OS scheduler with threads executing log I/Os, and (d) contention appears as transactions serialize accesses to in-memory log data structures. We demonstrate these problems and address them with techniques that, when combined, comprise a holistic, scalable approach to logging. Our solution achieves a 2069{\%} speedup over a modern database system when running log-intensive workloads, such as the TPC-B and TATP benchmarks, in a single-socket multiprocessor server. Moreover, it achieves log insert throughput over 2.2 GB/s for small log records on the single-socket server, roughly 20 times higher than the traditional way of accessing the log using a single mutex. Furthermore, we investigate techniques on scaling the performance of logging to multi-socket servers. We present a set of optimizations which partly ameliorate the latency penalty that comes with multi-socket hardware, and then we investigate the feasibility of applying a distributed log buffer design at the socket level.},

@phdthesis{Abadi2008,
abstract = {There are two obvious ways to map a two-dimension relational database table onto a one-dimensional storage interface: store the table row-by-row, or store the table column-by-column. Historically, database system implementations and research have focused on the row-by row data layout, since it performs best on the most common application for database systems: business transactional data processing. However, there are a set of emerging applications for database systems for which the row-by-row layout performs poorly. These applications are more analytical in nature, whose goal is to read through the data to gain new insight and use it to drive decision making and planning. In this dissertation, we study the problem of poor performance of row-by-row data layout for these emerging applications, and evaluate the column-by-column data layout opportunity as a solution to this problem. There have been a variety of proposals in the literature for how to build a database system on top of column-by-column layout. These proposals have different levels of implementation effort, and have different performance characteristics. If one wanted to build a new database system that utilizes the column-by-column data layout, it is unclear which proposal to follow. This dissertation provides (to the best of our knowledge) the only detailed study of multiple implementation approaches of such systems, categorizing the different approaches into three broad categories, and evaluating the tradeoffs between approaches. We conclude that building a query executor specifically designed for the column-by-column query layout is essential to achieve good performance. Consequently, we describe the implementation of C-Store, a new database system with a storage layer and query executor built for column-by-column data layout. We introduce three new query execution techniques that significantly improve performance. First, we look at the problem of integrating compression and execution so that the query executor is capable of directly operating on compressed data. This improves performance by improving I/O (less data needs to be read off disk), and CPU (the data need not be decompressed). We describe our solution to the problem of executor extensibilityhow can new compression techniques be added to the system without having to rewrite the operator code? Second, we analyze the problem of tuple construction (stitching together attributes from multiple columns into a row-oriented "tuple"). Tuple construction is required when operators need to access multiple attributes from the same tuple; however, if done at the wrong point in a query plan, a significant performance penalty is paid. We introduce an analytical model and some heuristics to use that help decide when in a query plan tuple construction should occur. Third, we introduce a new join technique, the "invisible join" that improves performance of a specific type of join that is common in the applications for which column-by-column data layout is a good idea. Finally, we benchmark performance of the complete C-Store database system against other column-oriented database system implementation approaches, and against row-oriented databases. We benchmark two applications. The first application is a typical analytical application for which column-by-column data layout is known to outperform row-by-row data layout. The second application is another emerging application, the Semantic Web, for which column-oriented database systems are not currently used. We find that on the first application, the complete C-Store system performed 10 to 18 times faster than alternative column-store implementation approaches, and 6 to 12 times faster than a commercial database system that uses a row-by-row data layout. On the Semantic Web application, we find that C-Store outperforms other state-of-the-art data management techniques by an order of magnitude, and outperforms other common data management techniques by almost two orders of magnitude. Benchmark queries, which used to take multiple minutes to execute, can now be answered in several seconds. (Copies available exclusively from MIT Libraries, Rm. 14-0551, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307.

@article{Lo2008,
abstract = {Many kinds of real-life data exhibit logical ordering among their data items and are thus sequential in nature. However, traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems and techniques were not designed for sequence data and they are incapable of supporting sequence data analysis. In this paper, we propose the concept of Sequence OLAP, or S-OLAP for short. The biggest distinction of S-OLAP from traditional OLAP is that a sequence can be characterized not only by the attributes' values of its constituting items, but also by the subsequence/substring patterns it possesses. This paper studies many aspects related to Sequence OLAP. The concepts of sequence cuboid and sequence data cube are introduced. A prototype S-OLAP system is built in order to validate the proposed concepts. The prototype is able to support pattern-based grouping and aggregation, which is currently not supported by any OLAP system. The implementation details of the prototype system as well as experimental results are presented.},
