\section{Summary and Next Steps}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The constantly changing needs for efficient data analytics combined 
with the ever growing datasets, require  a system design which is 
flexible, dynamic and embraces adaptivity. We present techniques 
which streamline processes that constitute bottlenecks in data 
analysis and reduce the overall data-to-insight time. To remove data 
loading, we introduce a system that adapts to data heterogeneity and 
enables queries on variety of data formats. To reduce data cleaning 
overheads, we overlap cleaning operations with query execution and 
finally, we introduce physical tuning approaches which take advantage 
of data distribution as well as the reduced precision requirements of 
modern analytics applications.
