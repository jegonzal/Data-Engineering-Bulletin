abstract="The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heart of data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attribute correlations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications -- since rules would fail in the absence of pattern -- but also the identification of groups of mutually correlated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes, from which existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper, we describe a scalable, effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes, and is not restricted to a specific family of mapping functions, such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of the algorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to spot the correlated attributes. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed technique is linear on the number of elements and of correlations in the dataset.",

abstract="Large Convolutional Network models have recently demonstrated impressive classification performance on the ImageNet benchmark Krizhevsky et al. [18]. However there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or how they might be improved. In this paper we explore both issues. We introduce a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier. Used in a diagnostic role, these visualizations allow us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky et al on the ImageNet classification benchmark. We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. We show our ImageNet model generalizes well to other datasets: when the softmax classifier is retrained, it convincingly beats the current state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.",

abstract="The problem of identifying meaningful patterns in a database lies at the very heart of data mining. A core objective of data mining processes is the recognition of inter-attribute correlations. Not only are correlations necessary for predictions and classifications -- since rules would fail in the absence of pattern -- but also the identification of groups of mutually correlated attributes expedites the selection of a representative subset of attributes, from which existing mappings allow others to be derived. In this paper, we describe a scalable, effective algorithm to identify groups of correlated attributes. This algorithm can handle non-linear correlations between attributes, and is not restricted to a specific family of mapping functions, such as the set of polynomials. We show the results of our evaluation of the algorithm applied to synthetic and real world datasets, and demonstrate that it is able to spot the correlated attributes. Moreover, the execution time of the proposed technique is linear on the number of elements and of correlations in the dataset.",
