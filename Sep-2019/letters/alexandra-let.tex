The big data revolution and advancements in machine learning
technologies have revolutionized decision making, advertising,
medicine, and even election campaigns. Data-driven software now
permeates virtually every aspect of human activity and has the
ability to shape human behavior: it affects the products we view
and purchase, the news articles we read, the social interactions we
engage in, and, ultimately, the opinions we form. Yet, data is an
imperfect medium, tainted by errors, omissions, and biases. As a
result, discrimination shows up in many data-driven applications,
such as advertisements, hotel bookings, image search, and vendor
services. In this issue, we bring together an exciting collection
of recent and ongoing work that focuses on the problems of
fairness, diversity, and transparency in data-driven systems. This
collection highlights the central role that the data management
research community can play in detecting, informing, and mitigating
the effects of bias, skew, and misuse of data, and aims to create
bridges with work in related communities.
