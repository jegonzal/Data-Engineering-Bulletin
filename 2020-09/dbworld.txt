The March 2020 issue of the Data Engineering Bulletin is now available electronically via the IEEE Computer Society Bulletin web site https://lnkd.in/g8tb8fq The entire issue is also available as a single pdf file https://lnkd.in/gEGuta6

For this issue, Gerhard Weikum wrote an opinion piece “Entities with Quantities,” where he discussed how to find all entities through quantity-based web search, for example, “buildings taller than 500m” or “runners completing a marathon under 2:10h.” It requires advanced data preprocessing (e.g., information extraction, entity linking, etc.), and at least part of the data on the entire Web organized as a database.

Philippe Bonnet put together the current issue consisting of 5 papers from leading researchers in the high performance computing and data management communities on the topic of data management at Exascale. Advances in exascale computing on petascale supercomputers are pushing the frontier of scientific computing that requires complex simulation, benefiting applications ranging from astrophysical discovery to drug design. But with increasing amounts of data, the gap between computation and I/O has grown significantly wider, which makes data management a big challenge. This timely issue answers many questions in this domain.
